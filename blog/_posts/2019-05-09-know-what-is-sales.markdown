Well basically sales is **a continous and an ongoing activity** where **one fulfills a need of another** by showcasing and providing a **solution**. This solution could be in a shape of **product or service** or mix of both. The another pays some thing to the one as a gesture of goodness or happiness. This some thing could be a **currency** or any thing valuable.

In current century or modern era most of the payments are done by either physical or digital currency. The exchange of valuable goods between one and another (known as **Barter System**) does not or partially exist.

In modern world the sales definition is very straight forward.

As per [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sale.asp){:target="blank"}
>
> A sale is a **transaction between two or more parties in which the buyer receives goods—either tangible or intangible—services, and/or assets in exchange for money** or in some cases, other assets paid to a seller. In the financial markets, a sale can also refer to an agreement that a buyer and seller make regarding the price of a security.

As per [Hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-sales){:target="blank"}
>
> The term, "sales", encompasses **all activities involved in selling a product or service to a consumer** or business. But "sales" means so much more for businesses.

## What all does sales or selling involve?

Selling involves a lot of stuff but the important ones without which selling as a process won't even exist are :-

- Problem (a need)
- Product (a solution to problem)
- Market (the place of transaction)
- Customers (the ones who buy)
- Payment (the mode of transaction)

A sale determines that the **seller** provides the **buyer** with a **good or service**, in exchange for a specific amount of **money** or particular **assets**.

To complete a sale, both the buyer and the seller have to be considered to be competent to make the **transaction**. They also both have to be in **agreement** regarding the specific **terms** of the sale.

Also, the good or service that is being offered has to actually be **available to purchase** and the seller has to have the **authority to transfer** the item or service to the buyer. This is what markets provide - a platform where products are available to be sold and bought.

**In this age Internet is the biggest Market**. In early days of trade sellers and buyers used to flock bazaars, mandis etc to do transactions. Now-a-days, what seller has to do is:

- find a product
- build a website or get registered with an online marketplace such as Amazon, Etsy whatever
- start selling

Setting up and Doing business in 21st century has become easy, very easy.
