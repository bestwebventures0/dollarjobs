## Dollar Jobs is the biggest sales jobs board on planet Earth.

Most of the people (almost 90%; assuming remaining 10% are salespeople) have this misconception that a sales job is the worse job. *worst than military*.

These 90% people imagine a sales job where they have to travel all around the area, town, city, district, state, country, and wherever knocking on people's doors and sell products. If you are a conventional salesperson yourself and you are reading this then you might be thinking right now, this is what we do.

But, here at Dollarjobs the concept of a salesjob and a salesperson is totally different. We feel that every human (and every company) is doing sales daily, consciously and subconsciously (or directly and indirectly). How?

#### Let's first talk about companies or businesses. How they sell?

Ok, let's consider **Apple** for our first example. Apple is innovating and coming out with amazing, valuable products every year. It doesn't go door to door to sell its mobile phones, laptops and software. Apple does direct sales via retail stores but not door to door.

Second example could be the companies which neither sell door-to-door or directly are **Amazon, Google, and Facebook**. But these companies have products and they sell. **Silent Direct Sales** we could say.

Third example is **Amway**. It is doing billions of dollars of turnover every year and it sells its products through its own private network of consumers. Current consumers make new consumers to build a network and get commission. **Direct Marketing and Silent Door-to-Door Sales**.

Fourth example is **Eureka Forbes**. The real Door-to-door sales company but with years its aggressive door-to-door sales strategy has subsided to adopt new ways of marketing and sales.

#### Ok, now how we humans sell?

1. **By wearing nice clothes and clothes according to the occasion, by wearing nice perfumes - we sell our image**. Example - An anology rather - Imagine on each side of the road there is a seller selling shoes. On one side there is a shabbily dressed (as if haven't showered for couple of weeks) seller standing with no shed. On other side there is a well dressed seller (a fine fragrance emanates from that side) under a beautiful / modern shed. Both are selling at same prices. From whom would you buy?

2. **By taking advanced education such as MBA, Engineering etc - we sell our skills**. Example - Self explanatory, right.

3. There are many more such examples on how as humans we also sell on daily basis directly and indirectly. You can find yourself by observing your self.

Also, without sales / selling no company and no human can exist, grow and scale (or rise). Without sales industry the economy will collapse.
