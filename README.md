# what is this

Dollarjobs was a jobs board launched in 2019 as a clone of weworkremotely but for sales and marketing jobs. The project failed to gain any traction after marketing it for 6 months. so, hereby we are making it available to the public to refer it for whatever you want it for ..

# tech stack

- Webpacker 5
- Sprockets 4
- MySQL/SQLite
- Razorpay
- JQuery
- no tests

# updates

- this project ~~might be updated~~ was updated to Ruby on Rails 8 showcasing _how to update a Rails 6 app to Rails 8_. See the Diff here - [https://github.com/bestwebventures0/dollarjobs/compare/main...upgrade_to_rails_8](https://github.com/bestwebventures0/dollarjobs/compare/main...upgrade_to_rails_8).
- we have no intentions to move jquery to stimulus, as of now, because jquery gets our job done and we do NOT want to make our code complex for simple JS tasks.
- if you want to use Stripe than Razorpay then feel free to fork this project and contribute.
- we are using bootstrap5 and have no intentions of using tailwindcss for this project (though we started using tailwindcss for all our projects post 2022).
- not much but if you want us to build a MVP for you in Ruby on Rails v8+ then you can visit our [website](https://bestwebventures.in/).
- this project was updated by the team at [RailsForge Technologies](https://railsforgedev.com/services/rails-upgrades-and-optimization/#plans).
